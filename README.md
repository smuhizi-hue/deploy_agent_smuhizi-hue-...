# deploy_agent_smuhizi-hue-...
I firstly made  ascript that allowed me to  creat a parent directory called attendance_tracker_muhizi-hue, then added its sub directories and files inside. After that I download the  the content within the files , then entered them in my files through the script.uptdated the config.json file, handled interruptes and validated the environment before running it.
